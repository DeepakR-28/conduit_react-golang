## Why this project?<a name="why-this-project?"></a>

Conduit or [realworld](https://realworld.io) is a project on GitHub which allows people to learn new stacks and technologies.
It helps people to learn and deploy same project in different frameworks.
I wanted to learn Go for quite a while now, and hence started with this project. 

This project will give up an idea about the following concepts
- File structure in Go
- REST APIs in Go
- Connecting to MongoDB in Go
- Creating REST APIs in Go, with real time data
- working with JWT in Go
- Authentication and authorization in Go


This is one of the first project that I took after going over the basics of Go. I am learning, please let me know the places where things are over complicated, and places where wrong patters are used.

Let's break down these files into simpler modules
